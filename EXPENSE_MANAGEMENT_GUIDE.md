## 🔄 Complete Workflow Example

### 1. **Company Setup**
```
1. User signs up at /sign-up
2. Enters: Name, Email, Password, Company Name, Default Currency (USD)
3. System creates:
   - Company record with default currency
   - Admin user account
4. Redirected to /admin dashboard
```

### 2. **Admin Creates Team**
```
Admin creates users:
1. Manager: John (manager role)
   - Password: abc123def456 (auto-generated)
2. Employee: Sarah (employee role, manager: John)
   - Password: xyz789ghi012 (auto-generated)

Admin shares passwords with users via email/slack
```

### 3. **Admin Sets Approval Rules**
```
Rule: "Standard Approval Flow"
- Manager as First Approver: ✓ YES
- Approval Type: Sequential
- Sequence:
  - Step 1: John (Manager)
  - Step 2: CFO
  - Step 3: Admin
```

### 4. **Employee Submits Expense**
```
Sarah logs in → /employee
Submits expense:
- Amount: 500 EUR
- Category: Travel
- Description: "Flight to Berlin for client meeting"
- Date: 2024-01-15

System:
- Converts 500 EUR → 540 USD (using live exchange rate)
- Creates expense record
- Generates approval workflow:
  * Step 1: John (Manager) - PENDING
  * Step 2: CFO - PENDING
  * Step 3: Admin - PENDING
```

### 5. **Manager Approves**
```
John logs in → /manager
Sees Sarah's expense in pending approvals:
- Employee: Sarah
- Amount: 540 USD (converted)
- Category: Travel
- Description: Flight to Berlin...

John clicks "Review" → "Approve"
Comments: "Approved - valid business travel"

System:
- Marks Step 1 as APPROVED
- Moves to Step 2 (CFO now sees it)
```

### 6. **Sequential Approval**
```
CFO logs in → sees the expense
Approves with comment: "Budget approved"

Admin logs in → sees the expense
Final approval: "Approved"

System:
- All approvals complete
- Expense status → APPROVED
- Sarah sees "Approved" in her expense history
```

### 7. **Rejection Flow**
```
If any approver rejects:
- Expense status immediately becomes REJECTED
- No further approvals needed
- Employee sees rejection reason in history
- Workflow stops
```

## 🚀 Key Functionalities

### Multi-Currency Support
```typescript
// When employee submits expense in EUR
originalAmount: 500 EUR
companyDefaultCurrency: USD

// System fetches exchange rate
exchangeRate: 1.08
convertedAmount: 540 USD

// Both amounts stored for audit trail
```

### Conditional Approval Logic

#### Sequential
```
Manager → CFO → Admin
Each must approve before next step
```

#### Percentage (60%)
```
3 approvers assigned
2 approvals = 66% → APPROVED
Expense moves forward automatically
```

#### Specific Approver
```
If CFO approves → Auto-approve
Regardless of other approvers
```

#### Hybrid (60% OR CFO)
```
Either:
- 60% of approvers approve, OR
- CFO approves
→ Expense APPROVED
```

### Manager-First Workflow
```
isManagerApprover: true

Flow:
1. Direct Manager (Step 1)
2. Finance Team (Step 2)
3. Admin (Step 3)

If no manager assigned → Skip to Step 1 of rule
```
